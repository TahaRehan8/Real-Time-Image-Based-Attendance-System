I trained this Random Forest model on Colab, but camera access was not available there.
So, I saved the trained PKL files for the label_encoder and rf_classifier.
Running Random_forest_Live directly will retrain the model. 
However, by using these pre-trained PKL files, you can run the model by specifying their file paths in the "running.py" file.
Pre-trained PKL files are in "Trained pkl file folder"
